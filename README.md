# Student User App ESME
This project was made during our first year of engineering studies in the ESME Innovation program, to discover Android app development.
This is an Android application linked to a mock Firebase database supposed to compare to our school's student database.

The app contains a sign-in system, a home page and several subpages containing student grades, homework, upcoming events and a link to an external Moodle study resources hub.
